# Hill-Cipher
The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher which requires modulo arithmetic and works on fundamental matrix theory. This cryptographic technique uses a m x m square matrix as the key used to encrypt and decrypt the data. The fundamental matrix theory used is multiplication between matrices and inverses the matrix. In our study, we used two types of matrices i.e. 2x2 and 3x3 along with a key matrix of respective sizes. The complexity of the procedure increases when using matrices of higher order. We coded the Hill Cipher technique in the language C++ depicting both encryption and decryption techniques.
Importantly, not every matrix is a possible key matrix. This is because, in order to decrypt, we need to have an inverse key matrix, and not every matrix is invertible. In order to be a usable key, the matrix must have a non-zero determinant which is coprime to the length of the alphabet. Hill Cipher is a classic cryptographic algorithm that is strong regarding its security. The bigger the key matrix, the stronger the security aspect. The time complexity of a 3x3 matrix multiplication is T( n^3 ). In order to decrease the time complexity we can use Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication, and improve the time complexity to T (n^2.807 ). The fastest algorithms so far is that of Coopersmith and Winograd with its efficiency in O (n^2.376 ). This particular algorithm can further be worked upon to improve the time complexity in future.
